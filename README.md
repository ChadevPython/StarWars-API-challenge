# StarWars-API-challenge

This is a hands on challenge for a Chadev Python meetup presentation on API's and Python debuggers by juzten. This challenge will help people get familiar with pulling data from an API and using a python debugger. Both topics were covered in the [OMG's, PDB's, and API's ](http://www.meetup.com/Chattanooga-Python-User-Group/events/225272460/) presentation on 9/21/2015. A sample script is provided to help get a jump start on pulling from the SWAPI.
